# Driver Safety System using Microcontroller and Image Processing
The Driver Safety System is designed to prevent accidents caused by driver fatigue and intoxication. Using microcontroller technology and image processing algorithms, the system detects drowsiness and intoxication of the driver, controls vehicle speed, and ensures road safety.

## Features
- Driver drowsiness detection
- Lane and vehicle detection
- Notification sending and GPS tracking

## Implementation Details
The system is implemented using:
- Arduino microcontroller
- Python with OpenCV library for image processing
- Various sensors including Ultrasonic and MQ3
- GPS module for location tracking

## Setup Instructions
1. Connect the hardware components according to the provided schematics.
2. Install the necessary software dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file.
3. Configure the system parameters as needed.
4. Run the main Python script to start the system.

## Usage
1. Ensure all connections are properly set up and the system is powered on.
2. Monitor the system alerts for drowsiness or intoxication detection.
3. Follow the instructions provided by the system for corrective actions, if needed.

## Results

- Drowsiness detection accuracy: 97%
